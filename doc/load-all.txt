*load-all.vim*  "Load All" option to the file changed warning dialog

Vim plugin that adds "Load All" option to the warning dialog when a file is
changed outside Vim.

If files opened in Vim are changed outside of the editor, for example when
you switch Git branches or after a shell command, Vim will show a warning and
ask to reload the file or keep the existing version (warning W11 or W12).
These warning errors will occur every time you open any changed file and can
be annoying when multiple files are changed.

This plugin adds a "Load All" option to reload all changed files and to
prevent Vim from asking again. The plugin works similar to the same dialog in
MacVim.

The plugin wil also autoupdate file timestamps if the file contents are the
same and only the mode or timestamp was changed.
