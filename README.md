# load-all.vim

Vim plugin that adds "Load All" option to W12 file changed dialog instead of asking it every time you open changed file. Works similar to the same dialog in MacVim.

## TODO

- [ ] Check different [reasons](https://neovim.io/doc/user/eval.html#v:fcs_reason) ('mode', 'time', 'deleted' etc)
- [ ] Check how it works with [autoread](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'autoread') off.
- [ ] Localization
- [ ] Don't checktime all if you did not select "Load All"?
- [ ] Make it look nicer than default confirm dialog?
